### Introduction
Font Hinting has always been thought of as a 'Black Art', some magic performed behind the scenes, hard to grok, and very difficult to do. To some extent this was true, for hinting done many years ago, when poor screens and older font rendering required a lot of hinting code to contol almost every feature in the font. It was an extremely time consuming, skilled, and manual process. The good news is, that is no longer the case. Hinting has become a lot easier and the built in autohinting in VTT will do a lot of the heavy lifting, leaving only fine tuning to be done. As screen resolutions and font rendering have gotton better, hinting has also become a lot less complicated, with only a handful of instructions needed to ensure consistent and beautiful rendering on screen. The VTT (VISUAL TRUE TYPE) tool has been upgraded to handle all aspect of hinting for Variable fonts. The following tutorial details all of the steps you will need, to use VTT to add and fine tune the hinting in Variable fonts, for excellent onscreen display.
